**full-stack · ai engineering · devops**  
learning how modern systems are built end to end

---

21 y/o self-taught developer focused on understanding things from first principles.  
currently building depth across backend, distributed systems, devops, and applied ai.

## what i'm doing right now

learning in public, studying system internals,  
building small full-stack and ai systems from scratch,  
and working toward becoming a top 1% engineer.

## areas i'm diving into

**full-stack engineering**  
backend systems · apis · microservices

**llms · rag · agents · ai infra**  
building intelligent systems

**cloud · containers · orchestration · ci/cd**  
infrastructure at scale

## stack i vibe with

**languages**  
typescript · python · go · rust

**frontend**  
react · next.js · tailwind

**backend**  
fastapi · node.js

**databases**  
postgres · redis · mongodb

**infra & tools**  
docker · kubernetes · github actions · aws

**ai/ml**  
langchain · langgraph · pytorch

## currently exploring

- how distributed systems scale and fail
- how to productionize llms and agentic workflows
- how devops, networking, and cloud infra work in real systems
- designing reliable full-stack architectures from scratch
